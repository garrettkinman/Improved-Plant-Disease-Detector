# Improved-Plant-Disease-Detector
Revamped and improved version of the Transferrable Plant Disease Detector project. This project includes a port over to Julia and Flux.jl, as well as further model designs/improvements.

The key goal of the project is to create a classifier that can detect whether a leaf is healthy or not, including for unseen species.

## Dataset
The test and validation sets are from the [PlantVillage](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1) dataset, reclassified into just two categories: healthy vs diseased.

The training set is from a combination of the [PlantLeaves](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1) and the [PlantaeK](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t6j2h22jpx/1) datasets.
